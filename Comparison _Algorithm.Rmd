## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load data}
ResToolMarks <- readRDS("ResToolMarks.Rds")
```



```{r  Select data}
#Creates a selection of toolmarks based on the file names

Selection1 <- K1_Z1_A1_ROI1 <- ResToolMarks %>%
  filter(Tool == "K1" & Zone == 1 & Side == "A1" & ROI == 1) %>% select(File,y)

#create a table of all possible combination without any repetitions

Comb_table <- as.data.frame(t(combn(length(Selection1$y),2)))
```



```{r Comparison Scores}
# Available functions : CCF, CCF_all, Aligned_scores. 
#Aligned_scores automatically calls CCF and CCF_all

Res1 <- Aligned_scores(Selection1,Comb_table)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
